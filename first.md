First thing, a few concept:

- rvm and rbenv are managers. They allow you to mannage multiple installations
  of Ruby.
- Gem look same as npm in Nodejs
- `bundle command` same as command `npm install`
- Gemfile same as package.json in Nodejs.

#### Install Ruby

- In Debian or Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install ruby-full`
- In Centos, Fedora: `sudo yum install ruby`
- Build from source:
Download the source code from: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
```
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
By default, this will install Ruby into /usr/local. To change, pass the
--prefix=DIR option to the ./configure script.


#### Install Rail

With specific version number `gem install rails -v 5.1.2`

#### First Application

`rails new hello_app`

After creating a new Rails application, the next step is to use Bundler to
install and include the gems needed by the app.
The `bundle install` command might take a few moments, but when itâ€™s done
our application will be ready to run.

If you get the message saying you need to run `bundle update` first, let do 
it.

== Running rails server ==

`rails server` then access from browser: 0.0.0.0:3000
